# RadioWhisper

Or something, idk I haven't decided on a name.

This project uses an RTL-SDR to receive narrowband FM from something like a repeater
and transcribes the audio with OpenAI Whisper, sending the result and the audio to
a group chat on Signal Messenger using an existing [signal-cli](https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli/)
daemon.

This project is for demonstration, education, and entertainment purposes.
